Empowered People API
======

## Overview

  This API was created to contain the data used in the Empowered People app. It compiles data from multiple educational and entertainment resources.  

* Ruby version
  - Ruby '2.7.0'
* Additional Gems
  - bcrypt '3.1.7'
  - jwt
  
## Database Creation

  This API runs on a PostgreSQL database. For help regarding the creation of a PostgreSQL database I suggest you visit [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_create_database.htm). I found [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/blog/2018/10/how-to-start-stop-restart-postgresql-server.html) to be the most informational, with regards to stoping and starting a PostgreSQL database.
  
## Database initialization

  You will need to fork both the front and backend.
  
## How to run the test suite
  To run the current, 2/9/21, database use the command line `rails s -p 3002`
